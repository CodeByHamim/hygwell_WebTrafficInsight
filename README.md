# Web Traffic Data Analysis

This project analyzes web traffic data (events like pageviews and clicks) over a 7-day period using Python. The dataset contains various dimensions, including the geographical origin of the traffic and the content of the page. The project focuses on understanding the volume, distribution of events, and exploring strategies to increase click-through rates (CTR).
